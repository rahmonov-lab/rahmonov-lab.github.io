<h1>How to get employed at Google?</h1>

<small>2019-02-10 20:10</small>

<p>TL;DR Read three books, watch two classes, solve problems at topcoder/codeforces/projecteuler. Links are below.</p>

<p>If you are interested in getting a job at Google, you’ve probably already read Steve Yegge’s famous post (if you didn’t, read it first). It assumes you have only a couple of weeks for preparation and focuses on topics. I used it as a checklist. This recipe focuses on resources; depending on your background, requires 3-6 months, and gives you pretty good chances to pass the interview even if you never knew the difference between a graph and a hash table.</p>

<p>After following the recipe you will</p>

<p>have basic math, algorithm and data structure knowledge required for the interview
change the way you think about problems, expressing them using mathematical models (it is not scary, rather fun)
possibly love learning. Here at Google it is a continuous process and not less intensive.
learn nothing about system design (see below)
I spent 2/3 of time on education and 1/3 on solving problems, but that’s because I had almost zero CS knowledge. If you just need a refresher, you should probably spend more time on problems.</p>
